        <h2 class="subtitle">
            I usually spend my time learning something new, whether that be a technology, framework, or even non-programming related things. 
            <br>
            Otherwise, I'm working on a project or tinkering with some old projects to make it better.

            <strong>What about when I'm not writing code?</strong>
            <br>
            I enjoy spending time with Friends and Family or unwinding with some Video Games.
